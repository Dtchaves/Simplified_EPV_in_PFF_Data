# Simplified-EPV-Evaluation

This repository contains a simplified implementation of the framework for evaluating the instantaneous expected value (EPV) of soccer possessions, based on the PFF data. The goal is to provide a straightforward approach to analyzing soccer possession data and estimating its value.

## Overview

The provided implementation streamlines the process of calculating EPV for soccer possessions using data from PFF. This approach simplifies the methodology discussed in the paper "A Framework for the Fine-Grained Evaluation of the Instantaneous Expected Value of Soccer Possessions."

## Features

- Simplified EPV calculation
- Based on PFF data
- Easy-to-understand code and implementation

## Installation

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dtchaves/Simplified-EPV-Evaluation.git
```
